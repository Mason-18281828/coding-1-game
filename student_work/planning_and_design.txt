Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
A forest maze which changes where you have to find enough collectables to go through the portal.

Game Rules:
Move and collect while upgrading gear and dodging enemies.
Obstacles: walls (possibly and boxes)
Scoring system: how few hearts lost and rooms entered
Win condition: enter a portal
Lose condition: get hit by # hearts times
Normal move controls, press 'e' by chests to open

30 by 30 squares for size

Major Game Elements:
Collecting gems. Speed upgrading.

Gameplay Process:
go through rooms. collect gems. dodge enemies. go through the portal

the plan:
1. create backgrounds and character/monster/gem/chest/plant/hearts designs
2. create functions for how various monsters move and for rng for chest and monster chance and for room chance
3. put in inputs from player and start creating the home screen
4. put in a way to up the ability via limited hearts and more devious rng
5. incorporate boss mode (make the boss, show how the boss works, etc.)
